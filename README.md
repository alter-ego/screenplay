Screenplay
==========

Screenplay is a minimalist framework for building Android applications, powered by Square's [Flow](http://corner.squareup.com/2014/01/mortar-and-flow.html).
Screenplay defines a simple application lifecycle based on the Flow navigation stack. The core
features that Screenplay provides are:

- **a rigging system** for attaching views, with support for
    - single-page views: full-screen layouts
    - stacked views: floating layouts and drawers
- **an animation system** for applying transitions between screens,
- **pluggable components** for applying behavior to screens,
- **view state reattachment** for configuration changes.

A typical Screenplay app is constructed from a single Activity and multiple Views. As navigation
events occur, objects called `Scenes` are pushed and popped from the Flow backstack. Each scene
transition consists of four discrete phases:

1. The `Scene` creates a view,
2. Scene `Components` receive callbacks and apply behavior
3. A `Rigger` attaches the scene to the layout.
4. A `Transformer` plays animations between the incoming and outgoing scene.

These steps are applied by the `Screenplay` object, which implements the `Flow.Listener` interface.
Screenplay knows how to reverse these steps when the back button is pressed.

###Setting the stage

Configuring a Screenplay app is straightforward. Create a `Screenplay.Director`, which binds the
Activity. Construct the `Screenplay` object, and create a new `Flow`. In order to ensure
that your Flow survives configuration changes, these objects should be stored outside of your main
Activity. One way to do this is to put them in the Application class:

```java
public class SampleApplication extends Application {

    public final SimpleActivityDirector director = new SimpleActivityDirector();
    public final Screenplay screenplay = new Screenplay(director);
    public final Flow mainFlow = new Flow(Backstack.single(new HomeScreen()), screenplay);
    private static SampleApplication application;

    public void onCreate() { application = this; }

    public static SampleApplication getInstance()       { return application; }
    public static SimpleActivityDirector getDirector()  { return getInstance().director; }
    public static Screenplay getScreenplay()            { return getInstance().screenplay; }
    public static Flow getMainFlow()                    { return getInstance().mainFlow; }
}
```

*(alternatively, use a dependency injection library such as [Dagger](http://square.github.io/dagger/))*

In the onCreate() method of your main Activity, bind your `Director` and call
`Screenplay.enter(flow)` to initialize the screen state:

```java
public class MainActivity extends Activity {

    private SimpleActivityDirector director;
    private Flow flow;
    private Screenplay screenplay;

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {

        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);

        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);
        RelativeLayout container = (RelativeLayout) findViewById(R.id.main);

        director = SampleApplication.getDirector();
        flow = SampleApplication.getMainFlow();
        screenplay = SampleApplication.getScreenplay();

        director.bind(this, container);
        screenplay.enter(flow);
    }
}
```

Calling `enter` will initialize the Flow to the current screen, and also re-attach any Views that
were detached during configuration changes.

Once you've created your Flow, navigation is the same as in any other Flow application:

```java
    flow.goTo(new DetailScene()); // animates forward to the DetailScene
    flow.goUp();                  // animate back to the parent of the scene
    flow.goBack();                // animate back to the previous scene
```

One final detail: when the Activity is destroyed, is important to drop references to it to
avoid memory leaks. Using the `SimpleActivityDirector`, you can drop the old Activity reference by
calling `unbind()` in your Activity's `onDestroy()` callback.

```java
    @Override
    public void onDestroy() {
        super.onDestroy()
        director.unbind()
    }
```

If you're using `MortarActivityDirector`, call `dropView()` instead. In either case, the Director
should be rebound the next time that `onCreate()`.

###Anatomy of a Scene

The building block of a Screenplay app is a `Scene`. The Scene knows how to do
only a few things by itself: create a View (`Scene.setUp`), destroy a View (`Scene.tearDown`) and
get the current view (`Scene.getView`).

The standard scene implementation uses Flow's [Layouts.createView()](https://github.com/square/flow/blob/master/flow/src/main/java/flow/Layouts.java)
to set up the scene. You can pass a list of `Component`s to the scene constructor, which can be used
to apply behaviors after the scene is set up and before it is torn down:

```java
@Layout(R.layout.dialog_scene)
public class DialogScene extends StandardScene {
    public DialogScene(DrawerLockingComponent component) {
        addComponent(component);
    }
}
```

```java
public class DrawerLockingComponent implements Scene.Component {

    private final DrawerPresenter drawer;

    public DrawerLockingComponent(DrawerPresenter drawer) {
        this.drawer = drawer;
    }

    @Override
    public void afterSetUp(Context context, Scene scene) {
        drawer.setLocked(true);
    }

    @Override
    public void beforeTearDown(Context context, Scene scene) {
        drawer.setLocked(false);
    }
}

```


###Riggers and Transformers

In a Screenplay app, when the application calls `Flow.goTo()` or `Flow.goBack()`, the type of layout
change that is applied depends on the type of ``Screen.Rigger`` that is associated with the next
scene. Screenplay provides two concrete `Rigger` implementations.

- The `PageRigger` manages full-screen layout changes. After all animations complete, the PageRigger
removes the previous screen from its parent layout.
- The `ModalRigger` manages partial-screen layout changes. It does not remove the previous Scene
from the layout, allowing you to layer Scenes on top of each other. This is useful for creating
partial-screen views, such as floating views, dialogs and drawers.

Both the `PagedRigger` and the `ModalRigger` remove the Scene at the top of the stack when
`Flow.goBack()` is called.

```java
@Layout(R.layout.navigation_drawer)
public class NavigationDrawerScene extends StandardScene {

    private final ModalRigger rigger;
    private final NavigationDrawerTransformer transformer;

    public NavigationDrawerScene() {
        this.rigger = new ModalRigger();
        this.transformer = new NavigationDrawerTransformer();
    }

    @Override
    public Rigger getRigger() {
        return rigger;
    }

    @Override
    public Transformer getTransformer() {
        return transition;
    }
}
```

A `Transformer` is responsible for applying animations between scenes. The `Transformer` receives a
`SceneCut` object, which contains the data that the `Transformer` needs to create animations,
including the `Flow.Direction`, and the incoming and outgoing stages.

```java
@Singleton
public class HorizontalSlideTransformer extends TweenTransformer {

    private static final Params params = new Params();

    static {
        params.forwardIn    = R.anim.slide_in_right;
        params.backIn       = R.anim.slide_in_left;
        params.backOut      = R.anim.slide_out_right;
        params.forwardOut   = R.anim.slide_out_left;
    }

    public HorizontalSlideTransformer(Application context) {
        super(context, params);
    }
}
```

Screenplay provides two `Transformer` implementations to extend from: `TweenTransformer`
and `AnimatorTransformer`. TweenTransformer uses the [Animation](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/animation/Animation.html) class, while
the AnimatorTransformer uses the [Animator](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/animation/Animator.html) class.

###Odds and ends

The `Screenplay` object also exposes a `SceneState` object. This is useful for preventing multiple
button presses while two Scenes are in transition:

```java
    @Override
    public boolean onOptionsItemSelected(MenuItem item) {
        // Ignore menu click if stage is transitioning
        if (screenplay.getScreenState() == SceneState.TRANSITIONING) return true;

        switch (item.getItemId()) {
            ...
        }
    }
```

###Mortar support

Screenplay provides support for (but does not require) Square's [Mortar](http://corner.squareup.com/2014/01/mortar-and-flow.html).
It provides two classes, a [MortarActivityDirector](https://github.com/weefbellington/screenplay/blob/master/library/src/main/java/com/davidstemmer/screenplay/MortarActivityDirector.java)
and a [ScopedScene](https://github.com/weefbellington/screenplay/blob/master/library/src/main/java/com/davidstemmer/screenplay/scene/ScopedScene.java),
which are designed to support applications powered by Mortar.

###Get the code!

Screenplay is designed to be simple and extensible. Along with Flow, it works well in concert with
its friends Dagger, Mortar and Butterknife. You can see them all together in the
[mortar sample project](https://github.com/weefbellington/screenplay/tree/master/sample-mortar).
If you'd rather see a more stripped-down example, you can take a look at the
[simple sample project](https://github.com/weefbellington/screenplay/tree/master/sample-simple)
which only requires Flow.

Many thanks to the team at Square for their support of the open-source community, without which this
project wouldn't be possible.

Maven artifact is coming soon!
